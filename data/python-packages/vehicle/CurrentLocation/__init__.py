    Attributes
    ----------
    Altitude: sensor
        Current altitude relative to WGS 84 reference ellipsoid, as measured at the position of GNSS receiver antenna.

        Unit: m
    GNSSReceiver: branch
        Information on the GNSS receiver used for determining current location.

        Unit: None
    Heading: sensor
        Current heading relative to geographic north. 0 = North, 90 = East, 180 = South, 270 = West.

        Value range: [0, 360]
        Unit: degrees
    HorizontalAccuracy: sensor
        Accuracy of the latitude and longitude coordinates.

        Unit: m
    Latitude: sensor
        Current latitude of vehicle in WGS 84 geodetic coordinates, as measured at the position of GNSS receiver antenna.

        Value range: [-90, 90]
        Unit: degrees
    Longitude: sensor
        Current longitude of vehicle in WGS 84 geodetic coordinates, as measured at the position of GNSS receiver antenna.

        Value range: [-180, 180]
        Unit: degrees
    Timestamp: sensor
        Timestamp from GNSS system for current location, formatted according to ISO 8601 with UTC time zone.
